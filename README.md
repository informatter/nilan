# Nilan

Nilan is a programming language I am currently developing for fun ðŸš€ and I am implementing it in Go 

My goal is to learn more about how a programming language works under the hood and further explore the different pipelines involved  to take source code as input and make the CPU execute the instructions ðŸ¤–
